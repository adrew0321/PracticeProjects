# Practice Projects

This repository will be a general hub of the practice projects that I personally use in order to sharpen my skills. I'll mainly be using the C# programming language,
however this repo will be scallable to include different programming languages and techniques. Furthermore, the programs will be listed based on the specific topic that it may work well with. This will allow for a broader range of knowledge in order to help understand some key concepts that will be covered.
